### Paper Mario: TTYD Infinite Pit Mod (v1.00 r22) by Jdaster64

### Credits
* **PistonMiner** - For the initial REL framework and related tools, and ttydasm, which was immensely useful as reference for vanilla TTYD event scripts; both can be found on the [ttyd-tools repository](https://github.com/PistonMiner/ttyd-tools).
* **Zephiles** - For the [TTYD practice codes](https://github.com/Zephiles/TTYD-Practice-Codes) (both for ease of testing, and for implementation reference), contributions towards the REL framework (in particular, methods for loading the REL), and creating the original Pit Randomizer, which was the primary inspiration for this mod.
* Both of the above, **Jasper**, **SolidifiedGaming** and other folks who've helped with TTYD documentation.
* **Kappy** and **Fatguy703** for pre-release playtesting and feedback.
