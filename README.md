### Paper Mario: TTYD Infinite Pit Mod (v1.00 r22) by Jdaster64

### Credits
* **PistonMiner** - For the REL framework and related tools, and ttydasm, which was immensely useful as reference for vanilla TTYD event scripts; both can be found on the [ttyd-tools repository](https://github.com/PistonMiner/ttyd-tools).
* **Zephiles** - For the [TTYD practice codes](https://github.com/Zephiles/TTYD-Practice-Codes) (both for testing and the code for implementation reference), and original Pit Randomizer as inspiration for this mod.
* **Jasper**, **SolidifiedGaming** and other folks who've helped with TTYD documentation
* **Kappy** and **Fatguy703** for pre-release playtesting feedback
